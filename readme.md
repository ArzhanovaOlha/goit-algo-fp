As we can see on the grafics, the results of the algorithm became more
accurate then we simmulate the roll of the dice more then 1000 times.
In that case we can get the result close to the result of the 
analitacal calculation.
Method Monte Carlo is based on statistical random selection, 
that's why it needs big count of random data to get more accurate results.
